# Mac Emulation

## For for Newton Tool Kit

So you picked up the forked version of BasiliskII/SHeepShaver from https://github.com/MatthiasWM/macemu . 
This is a fork from the latest git repo I could find at https://github.com/emaculation/macemu . I made a
few modifications for the macOS host platform that were needed to get BasiliskII to connect with the Newton Emulator 
"Einstein" at https://github.com/pguyot/Einstein . Just set the preferences entry "seriala" to "tcp:3679"
and the serial port will behave like a TCP/IP server, listening on port 3679 for incoming connections.

I fixed copy/paste of text which would occasionally crash on macOS. Also, the CapsLock
key would lock forwever on the current version of SDL2.

This code should compile out of the box on macOS Cataline in 64 bit mode.

### Original Content

This repository contains the [BasiliskII](BasiliskII/) and [SheepShaver](SheepShaver/) projects.  It is an attempt to centralize the individual development efforts that have gone on in the absence of the original [cebix/macemu](https://github.com/cebix/macemu) repository owner.

The [cxmon](https://github.com/emaculation/cxmon) project has been split from this repository.

### How To Build

These builds need the SDL2 framework/library to be installed.

`.travis.yml` and `appveyor.yml` contain the build scripts for CI.  More generally, here are the steps:

#### BasiliskII
##### macOS
1. Open BasiliskII/src/MacOSX/BasiliskII.xcodeproj
1. Set Build Configuration to Release
1. Build

##### Linux(x86)
```
$ cd macemu/BasiliskII/src/Unix
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
```
##### MinGW32/MSYS
```
$ cd macemu/BasiliskII/src/Windows
$ ../Unix/autogen.sh
$ make
```
#### SheepShaver
##### macOS
1. Open SheepShaver/src/MacOSX/SheepShaver.xcodeproj
1. Set Build Configuration to Release
1. Build

##### Linux(x86)
```
$ cd macemu/SheepShaver
$ make links
$ cd src/Unix
$ ./autogen.sh
$ make
```
##### MinGW32/MSYS
```
$ cd macemu/SheepShaver
$ make links
$ cd src/Windows
$ ../Unix/autogen.sh
$ make
```


## Bug reports

You found a bug? Well, open an issue in this repo, supplying as much information as possible (operating system and versions of Basilisk II and MacOS being used, relevant hardware information, the exact steps to reproduce the bug, etc.)

I also strongly suggest reading this before posting a bug report:

## Support

There is no point in sending questions about ROM files and how/where to get them.
